### About Me
What's up? I'm Nishchal, a 20-year-old computer engineering major who enjoys web and app development. My knowledge base in computer science and various programming languages is intact, and I constantly seek to upgrade my skills. I like to phrase it as a coding Nobita who is curious about everything (without the need of Doraemonâ€™s tools, LOL!).

### Interests
I find the intersection between software development and design particularly interesting. I fully enjoy projects that appeal to my technical and creative skills at the same time. It is like building something elegant and useful like a Time Machine from the Doraemon comic series!

### Personal Development
I would consider myself an enthusiastic learner in my leisure time, especially in regard to new technologies or happenings in the world. I am always on the lookout for new frameworks, tools, and design trends. Iâ€™m like Nobita meeting his homework deadlines, thanks to assistance from Doraemon.
